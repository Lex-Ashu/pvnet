# Baseline Models

Idea is to have a really simple baseline model for predicting pv yield. 
First model is just to use the last pv yield amount. 
The reason to have this model is so that as we develop more complicated models, 
we can see how much 'better' they are doing. 


Want to try and keep the same setup as other pytorch models to 'make' it similar to run.
