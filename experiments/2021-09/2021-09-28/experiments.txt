1. Perceiver NWP SAT

https://app.neptune.ai/o/OpenClimateFix/org/predict-pv-yield/e/PRED-331/monitoring

Ran with
- batch_size of 6, as GPU was out of memory
- num_latents: int = 64,
- latent_dim: int = 64,
- embedding_dem: int = 0,

Each epoch takes about 3 hours

Decided to stop it earlier

1. Perceiver Conv3d NWP SAT

Idea is to have 1 conv3d + max pool later before the perceiver model
https://app.neptune.ai/o/OpenClimateFix/org/predict-pv-yield/e/PRED-331/monitoring

Conv3d did not make much memory difference, the biggest being, changing the
- num_latents
- latent_dim

To get batch 32, set
- num_latents = 16
- latent_dim = 16
- PERCEIVER_OUTPUT_SIZE = 512
OR
To get batch 32, set
- num_latents = 24
- latent_dim = 24
- PERCEIVER_OUTPUT_SIZE = 128

~ 4 hours per epoch

MAE = 0.0308 (after 10 epochs)
