# Baseline

Ran baseline on new v6 GCP dataset

https://app.neptune.ai/o/OpenClimateFix/org/predict-pv-yield/e/PRED-283/monitoring

Takes about 4 minutes to run the validation epoch

This is just for forecast 1 timestep in the future
MAE = 0.0562

# Conv3d

ran not using nwp data, or datetimte features
https://app.neptune.ai/o/OpenClimateFix/org/predict-pv-yield/e/PRED-314/monitoring

MAE = 0.0401

# Conv3d (Sat and NWP)

Using both sat and nwp into two separate convolution nets.
